--The ScreenSharing example extension--

This directory contains the source for an example Chrome Extension called ScreenSharing is a simple variant of the PageMirror extension.

The basic behavior is almost exactly identical, except for popping up a new tab in the same browser, the extension forwards changes to a NodeJS server.js which can relay those changes to any number of clients

--Requirements--

This example requires NodeJS to run the relay server. See http://nodejs.org for installation instructions.

--Installation--

1. Copy ../../mutation_summary.js and ../../tree_mirror.js to this directory.
2. Edit the serverURL variable in content.js to point to the machine on which you plan to run server.js. E.g. 'ws://mymachine:8080/projector'.
2. Navigate Chrome to chrome://extensions.
3. Click the 'Developer Mode' checkbox.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked extension...' button.
5. Navigate the file browser to this directory and click select.

This shoud load the extension and a little button with an icon of 'Evil Spock' should appear in the top-right corner of each Chrome window.

6. In the current directory, run node server.js (after having installed NodeJS)

--Usage---

1. Now try navigating to a web page which is highly dynamic. http://www.google.com is a good example.
2. Click the Spock button and move aside the tab which is opened.
3. Now point any other browser (which implements WebSockets) at the machine on which you started the server.js, port 8080. E.g. 'http://mymachine:8080'.
4. The contents of the "source" browsers tab will now to projected to this browser (and to all other browsers who are watching).

--Uninstallation--
